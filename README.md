# ENCODE 2025 HACKATHON - GENESIS VOID
---

## 🎮 The Game: GENESIS VOID

An on-chain AI sandbox game where every step you take carves reality out of the void.

Powered by Portia AI and LLM integration, just say "build a blue castle" and watch it appear in 3D before your eyes. 🏰✨

Players can **own tiles**, **rent land**, and **capture enemy tiles** in a world where everything — terrain, buildings, ownership, and state — is stored fully on-chain using Starkware’s **Dojo engine** and **Cairo 1.0**.

In a strategic twist, **surrounding enemy zones lets you capture the center** — think **Minecraft meets Monopoly**, all on the blockchain.

**Steve**, your AI assistant, turns your imagination into 3D assets, stores them in Supabase, and syncs them into the on-chain world. Built for full decentralization and player ownership.

Behind the scenes:
- **Dojo** handles the on-chain world state
- **Nethermind** powers seamless Starknet execution
- **Portia AI** + **LLMs** drive generative design

This isn’t just a game.  
It’s a living, breathing, generative world. And Steve? He’s here to help you shape it.

## 🧠 About STEVE (using Portia AI)

**STEVE** is an AI-powered agent designed to autonomously create and manage **3D assets** for a hybrid **Minecraft x Monopoly-style** game built on the **blockchain**. STEVE bridges the gap between player-driven creativity and scalable world-building by generating terrain, structures, and game elements that live on-chain.

## 🧩 Example Use Case

Let’s walk through how a player interacts with the world — and how STEVE brings their vision to life:


### 👤 1. User Input

The player chats with STEVE and says:

> _"Create a log house on this tile."_

STEVE parses the prompt, understands the tile index and neighbors, and begins generating the asset.

### 🖼️ 2. Image Generation

Using OpenAI's DALL·E and your chosen prompt, STEVE produces this concept art:

![image_gen_log_house_frontend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f2a2f15-5f2e-45d8-b41f-389e4446b74b)

> The image is saved locally, then sent to Stability AI for 3D conversion.

### 🌍 3. In-Game Asset Placement

The `.glb` model is rendered in the game world (via Three.js frontend) and automatically synced to its on-chain coordinates using Dojo.

![frontend_view_log_house](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb6fb0c-de07-44b4-a629-873919f9eb57)

> The asset lives on tile `27`, with metadata and ownership stored entirely on-chain — and the 3D model hosted via Supabase.

---

STEVE handles the entire pipeline: image → model → storage → on-chain registration → render.

## 🌐 Architecture Overview

- **🧠 Python Backend**: Uses Portia AI to generate images and 3D models from text prompts
- **🏗️ Dojo Engine**: Manages on-chain components, systems, and world logic using StarkNet
- **🎮 Three.js Frontend**: Renders tiles and 3D models in a fully interactive browser experience
- **🪂 Supabase**: Stores and serves public URLs for `.glb` and `.png` assets

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `pip` or `poetry`
- Dojo CLI (`sozo`, `katana`, `torii`)
- Node.js (for frontend)
- `.env` file with API keys:

  ```env
  PORTIA_API_KEY=

  OPENAI_API_KEY=
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=
  STABILITY_API_KEY=

  SUPABASE_URL=
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
  ```

---

## 📥 Install Backend Dependencies

Using `pip`:

```bash
cd python-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with `poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

---

## 🧪 Run Backend API Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

> Assumes your FastAPI entrypoint is in `app/main.py`.

---

## ⛓️ Run Dojo Locally (On-chain World)

From the `dojo/` directory:

```bash
katana     # in one terminal
torii --world <world_address>     # in another terminal
sozo migrate --name localworld    # to deploy the world
```

Configure your `dojo_dev.toml` with the deployed world address for Torii.

---

## 🖼️ Image + 3D Generation Flow

1. Portia AI receives a prompt
2. Generates an image using OpenAI DALL·E
3. Converts it to a 3D `.glb` model using Stability AI
4. Stores both files in `generated_assets/`
5. Uploads to Supabase and returns a public URL

---

## 🛰️ Example cURL Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scene_description": "A cherry blossom",
    "tile_index": 42,
    "neighbours": [11, 13, 7]
  }'
```

### ✅ Output

```json
{
  "uploaded_url": "https://<supabase-link>/encode-assets/42.glb"
}
```

---

## 🎮 Frontend (Three.js)

The frontend is located in `vue-frontend/` and uses **Three.js** to render tiles and load `.glb` models dynamically from Supabase.

### 📦 Setup

```bash
cd vue-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Make sure environment variables in the frontend match your Supabase setup.
